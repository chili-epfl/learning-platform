        <h2> Epidemic - Definition </h2>
        
        <p>An epidemic (from greek epi "upon or above" and demos "people") is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time.
        Once introduced to a population, infectious micro-organisms such as viruses and bacteria spread from person to person and so long that each person transmits the infection to more than other person the number of cases of the disease will grow exponentially.
        It is not the disease that is spreading but rather the organism that cause the disease.<br>
        
        
        The causes are :</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Biology of the micro-organism.</li>
        <li>Biology of the host.</li>
        <li>The environment.</li>
        </ul>
