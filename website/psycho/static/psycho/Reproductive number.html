                    <p>The basic reproduction rate Ro(R nought) is used to measure the transmission potential of a disease. It is thought of as the number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population that is totally susceptible. It can therefore be measured by counting the number of secondary cases following the introduction of an infection into a totally susceptible population.<br>
                    
                    
                    The basic reproductive rate Ro is set to be the product of the following three factors:</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>S = The rate of contact in the host population with susceptible people.</li>
                        <li>Beta = The probability of infection being transmitted during contact (Transmissibility).</li>
                        <li>L = The duration of infectiousness.</li>
