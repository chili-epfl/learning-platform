                <h2> Epidemic - Basic Reproductive Number </h2>
                    
                    <p>The basic reproduction rate called Ro(R nought) is used to measure the transmission potential of  disease. It is thought of as the number of secondary infections produced by a typical case of an infection in a population that is totally susceptible to get infected. It can therefore be measured by counting the number of secondary cases following the introduction of an infection into a totally susceptible population.<br/>
        
                        Ro =  Number of new cases of infection / Number of initial cases, during an infectious period of a suceptible popoulation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    The basic reproductive rate Ro is also set to be the product of the following three factors:</p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>S = The Number of suceptible hosts there are to get infected.</li>
                        <li>L = The duration of infectiousness of an individual. We can think that the more individuals remain infectious the longer they can transmit to others.<br>
                        S and L give us the potential number of contact over the course of an infection.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Beta = The probability of an infection being transmitted during contact (Transmissibility).</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p> An outbreak is only likely to spread if Ro >1 . </p>
