        <h2> Epidemic - Definition </h2>
        
        <p>An epidemic (from greek epi "upon or above" and demos "people") is the rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time.
        Once introduced to a population, infectious micro-organisms such as viruses and bacteria spread from person to person and so long that each person transmits the infection to more than other person the number of cases of the disease will grow exponentially.
        It is not the disease that is spreading but rather the organisms that cause the disease. For instance, there are diseases whose underlying cause cannot spread from person to person as diseases due to genetic causes or diseases due to toxine in the environment.<br>
        
        
        The causes of an epidemic are :</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Biology of the micro-organism that causes the disease.</li>
        <li>Biology of the host (the person that could be infected).</li>
        <li>The environment.</li>
        </ul>
